# Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study

This is my R source code for data combining, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization
for Google Data Analytics Case Study : Cyclistic Bike Share.


The cyclistic_combining_cleaning.R consists of source codes that I use to combine Cyclistic's data 
from May 2022 until April 2023 and then clean them before I proceed the analysis process.


The cyclistic_analyze.R consists of source codes that I use to conduct analyze phase and to perform
data visualization using RStudio.
